WELCOME COLLECTIVERS!!! Some info for the course

**"Agentic AI" SESSION-1**

Tool Requirements
Most of the hands-on work will happen in n8n, but we’ll rely on a few additional tools to power the chatbot, store vector data, and access our documents.

Here’s a quick overview of what you’ll need:

n8n: Our main tool
This is where we’ll build the chatbot workflows—no coding required. You can use either the hosted (cloud) version or run it locally on-premises.

If you’re new to n8n, I recommend starting with the hosted version, which comes with a free 14-day trial.

Optional: Beginner n8n Course
Optional: Self-hosting guide

**Large language model (LLM)**

The LLM powers both responses and vector embedding generation. n8n supports several LLMs out of the box. You’ll need an API key to connect one

If you don’t have an API key yet, I recommend Gemini. It’s easy to set up, doesn’t require a credit card, and offers a generous free tier.

Claude (Anthropic): Console (Tutorial)
